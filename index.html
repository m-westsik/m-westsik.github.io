							<h2>Who am I?<br /></h2>
						</header>
						<p>A postgraduate taught student studying on the MSc Robotics course at the University of Manchester. As an undergraduate, I was studying Aerospace
							Engineering at the same university and completed an Industrial Experience year at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh. I have a keen
							interest in learning about a diverse set of topics impacting our lives.

								<h3>Robotic Systems Design Project</h3>
								<p>Led a team of 4 students as part of the Robotic Systems Design Module to develop a robotic platform capable of autonomously identifying and retreiving target objects from
									an unknown environment. The team gained experience with the Leo Rover platform, RPLidar A2M12, PincherX 150 robotic manipulator, Intel RealSense D435 depth camera and an Intel NUC computer.
									I was personally responsible for the mechanical design and manufacturing in the team, and helped out with the development of the arm control system.

								<h3>3D Printing Industrial Placement</h3>
								<p>Worked within the AM4Space research group at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre, collaborated with project scientists, mechanical design engineers and project managers.
									 Designed a mirror petal, based on a CubeSat Earth Observation instrument, for Power Bed Fusion additive manufacturing. Was able to reduce the component sub-assembly's mass by 44% and
									 consolidated nine parts into a single part. Conducted design analysis and wrote a conference
									 paper summarizing the project which was orally presented by the project supervisor at the 2023 SPIE Optics + Photonics conference. 
									 Personally presented the work to multiple professional audiences, within the company and abroad. The presentation and publicaiton are available through this 
									 <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19IhHmwhyZPgT9-l5CpAuFHvwf-SK5eY7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">link</a>.

								<h3>Conceptual Aerospace Systems Design project</h3>
								<p>As part of our Conceptual Aerospace Systems Design module, we were given the task to develop a Space Debris Removal mission concept. Within our team, I took the Mission Analyst position 
									providing critical input to the team's work and shaping the mission concept from the very beginning. I analyzed ESA datasets for polluted orbits and types of pollution, wrote requirements, 
									did research on launch vehicles and propulsion systems, and answered critical questions during the tradeshow presentation. Our team recieved the Best Tradeshow Presentation award, and was 
									was given the highest mark out of all teams. For more information, read our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLNpdIW2FJRJQ_W_WgIgHMoJw9EseUVh/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">final report</a>.

								<h3>TRIZ Problem Solving</h3>
								<p>TRIZ provides a thinking framework for problem solving which stops 
									our cognitive momentum and, thus, helps us come up with innovative, out ideas 
									and solutions to our problems. Through a 3-day course I received good quality 
									and thorough learning material, was able to familiarize myself with its toolkits
									and practice them on example problems. For more information on TRIZ, 
									visit the <a href="https://www.triz.co.uk/what-is-triz" target="_blank">Oxford Creativity website</a>.
